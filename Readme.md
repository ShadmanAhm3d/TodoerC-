The project aims to provide a simple task management system implemented in C++. Users can add tasks, view existing tasks, and delete tasks from a list using command-line inputs. The program utilizes file I/O to store task information persistently. It's a lightweight and easy-to-use tool for managing personal or small-scale project tasks efficiently.
